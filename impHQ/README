These bundles and/or device firmwares are for demos and one-off projects at imp HQ. These projects may eventually:

1. Move to the examples directory - if they're simple enough to be built without a custom PCB, or don't involve any hacks so abhorent as to be discouraged from use.

2. Move to the reference designs directory - if the project is useful enough to warrant a custom PCB and is posted to the hardware examples page at http://devwiki.electricimp.com/doku.php?id=boards:start

Projects will typically move here from dev if they:

1. Came from a hackathon
2. Came from a special-purpose demo
3. Were built to test a concept that was not, for some reason or another, integrated into a reference design or developer example
