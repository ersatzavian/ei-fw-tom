dev/

This directory contains firmware that is incomplete, waiting on new API features, under active development but not ready for use, or backlogged. Each folder represents a single model bundle; a device firmware at minimum, optionally with an agent. 

Files from this directory will be moved to their permanent resting place when:
1. They are completed and promoted to an example, reference design, or impHQ demo bundle
2. They become obsolete or irrelevant and moved to old/
