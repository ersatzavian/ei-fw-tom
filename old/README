This folder contains firmwares and/or bundles that are obsolete or special-case. These bundles may be for devices that are no longer in one piece or have been revised sufficiently to require a new bundle. Firmware or bundles will be kept only if some or part of the code may be useful in future applications; completely obsolete, generic, or irrelevant code will be removed.
